Upload the Marlin-2.0.x-Creality-Ender-5.hex to your printer via Octoprint or your favourite slicer.

The Ender silent board should already have a bootloader installed, so all you should need is the hex file.

The configuration.h and configuration_adv.h are the config files that were used to build this firmware. They are just there for informative purposes and are not necessary for the purpose of flashing your printer.
